#write your code here

def countdown(int)
  x = int
while x > 0
  puts "#{number} SECOND(S)!"
  x -= 1
end
"HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
end

x = 1
while x < 10
  puts "#{x} is less than 10"
  x += 1
end

3. Write a method that takes in an integer argument and uses a while loop to countdown from that integer to `0`, outputting `"#{number} SECOND(S)!"` in each iteration of the loop. The method should return `"HAPPY NEW YEAR!"` after the loop finishes. **Hint:** *In Ruby, a method will return the very last line of code that it executes.*
